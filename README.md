<b> Getting a "Client ID" </b>
This is a very simple project that allows the user to mass download anyone's twitch clips for archival purposes. 
This project is using twitch.tv's V5 api and will require you to already have made a twitch application <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps">here</a>(https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
To make an application to get your "Client ID" all you have to do is click on the link, login, click "Applications".
From there you'll need to click "Register your application", fill out anything as the name, 
put "http://localhost" as the OAuth redirect url, choose other as the catagory and finally put whatever you want in for the description.
After you're done with that and created the bot, copy the "Client ID" and paste it into the bot. 

<b> Using the program </b>

This is rather straightforward, you do the previous steps, put in your Client id and the twitch channel, click on "fetch all clips", from there you'll be presented with the ability to choose where you want to save it,
navigate where you want it and then finally click "save".
